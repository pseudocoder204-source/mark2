# mark2

A multi-scanner home-network security pipeline. It combines several open-source
scanners into one agentic system that produces a **plain-English** security report for
non-technical users:

| Scanner | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **Nmap** | Open ports, service/version detection, CVE enrichment, IoT default-credential checks |
| **Trivy** | Local filesystem package vulnerabilities (Linux/macOS) |
| **Nuclei** | Web/network template-based vulnerability checks |
| **Lynis** / **Windows audit** | Host hardening audit (Linux/macOS via Lynis, Windows via a native PowerShell audit) |
| **ClamAV** / **Windows Defender** | Malware scan (ClamAV on Linux/macOS, Defender threat history on Windows) |

Each scanner has a parser and a self-contained [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
subgraph. A deterministic orchestration layer (`agent.py`) runs the scanners in a fixed
order, flattens all findings into a single table, and uses an LLM **only** to reorder and
explain those findings — never to choose what to scan. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full
architecture.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- The scanner binaries for your OS (see [Install the scanners](CONTRIBUTING_SCAN_DATA.md#install-the-scanners))
- An LLM backend: a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) model (default) **or** an Anthropic API key

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running a diagnostic

```bash
# Scan your own machine (default target 127.0.0.1) with the default Ollama backend
python3 agent.py [--target IP] [--json]

# Use Anthropic instead of Ollama
LLM_PROVIDER=claude ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python3 agent.py
```

You can also run any single scanner's subgraph standalone:

```bash
python3 nmap_subgraph.py [target]
python3 nuclei_subgraph.py [target]
python3 trivy_subgraph.py
python3 lynis_subgraph.py
python3 clamav_subgraph.py
```

### The CVE cache

CVE enrichment reads a local SQLite cache, `vulnerability_cache.db`. It's **~3.2 GB**, so
it is **not** in the repo — download the compressed copy (~126 MB) from the Releases page
and unpack it into the repo root:

```bash
gunzip -c vulnerability_cache.db.gz > vulnerability_cache.db
```

Without it, the pipeline creates an empty cache and syncs ~30 days of recent CVEs from NVD
on first run (slower, less complete). Set `NVD_API_KEY` for higher NVD rate limits.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t mark2 .
docker run --rm --network host -e TARGET=192.168.1.1 mark2
```

`--network host` is needed on Linux so Nmap/Nuclei can reach hosts on your LAN. See
`CLAUDE.md` for the full set of environment variables and volume mounts (CVE cache,
ClamAV manifest, etc.).

## Contributing scan data

This project is collecting **real, anonymized** scan findings to improve the report
model. If you'd like to help, run one scan on a machine you own and submit a single
small JSON file via this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQIl3y1xTYoaWhLFSuIMLQh6TmnucyQUBe1x5bK01qFlD1zw/viewform).
It records only a findings summary (ports, versions, CVE IDs, hardening test IDs,
package names) — **never** file contents, credentials, or logs, and it makes you review
and consent before scanning.

👉 **See [CONTRIBUTING_SCAN_DATA.md](CONTRIBUTING_SCAN_DATA.md) for the full walkthrough.**
